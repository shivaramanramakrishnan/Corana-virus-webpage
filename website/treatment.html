            <h2>TREATMENT:-</h2>
            <h1> There currently isnâ€™t a vaccine against developing COVID-19. Antibiotics are also ineffective because COVID-19 is a viral infection and not bacterial. <br> <br> If your symptoms are more severe, supportive treatments may be given by your doctor
                or at a hospital. This type of treatment may involve:<br> <br> *fluids to reduce the risk of dehydration <br> *medication to reduce a fever <br> *supplemental oxygen in more severe cases <br> <br> People who have a hard time breathing
                on their own due to COVID-19 may need a respirator.
